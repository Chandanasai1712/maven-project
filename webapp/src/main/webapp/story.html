        he found that A person named Albert has faced this Problem. Albert got an e-mail from an unknown person with the ID-"sector1e234s9p".He tried to open it, but it wasn't open. He understood that it's not a problem in the system. This e-mail has something interesting secrets. He found a solution for it , which was
a device that can communicate with some other creation. Albert shared about  this with his daughter as he invented a divice and he tested the divice that night. Then he died. His daughter said that he wrote a book about the divice. But the book is missing.

        Ishak was very interesting about this and he investigated Albert's daughter. But unfortunately she died,but his son is living in USA.His name is Ford.Ishak decided to go USA. but he doesn't have money to go to USA.So,he want to earn money. Then he went to bed.The next morning he got another Email with the Subject <mark><em>GO TO USA</EM></mark>
        He replied to the mail that <em>WHO ARE YOU ?</em>.After he got a mail with the subject of <em>Go and Check the bank balance.</em>

         He was shoked by seeing his bank balance,there is enough money to go to USA.He want to book a ticket to USA so he was searching for his passport but he wasn't able to find he passport.He checked all his documents in his house.He found some papers belongs to his grandfather.Ishak's grandfather was scientist at US. His name was ashok.He invented a thing.It was like a projector .Ishak taught that it  is at his grand mother's house.
         He was confused to go USA <em>or</em> to go to his grand mother's house.He dicided to go  his grand mother's house.He collected his grand father's documents and packed them all.
         Ishak's grandmother received him at the airport then he asked that "How do you know that i am coming ?" . He replied that i didn't send any message granny,then she gave her mobile and said you check the message my boy,but sudenly the message got disappeared .They leaved that topic and reached their home.After reaching home she asked do you want anything to eat or drink ? he asked for a coffee.
         Then he went to his grandpa's room and started searching for the device.Then his grandmother asked "What are you searching for?".He replied I'm searching for the device that the grandfather wrote in this document.His grand grand mother gave him a box and some papers th him.Granny gave the coffee to him and left the room.After drinking the coffee he opened the box and he found a thing that looks like bangle and the ring.Then he started reading the papers then he realised  that it's not a bangle it is the device he searching for and that has some super powers.
         He was very exictited to use that device but there no instructions for how to use.

        Backside of the paper he find a word called <b><em>Dairy</em></b>. He taught that may the instructions will be in the dairy.He started searching for the dairy he asked his grandmother about the dairy she said "May be it will be the lab! The lab is in the basement itself you can go there and search for the dairy" and be careful while searching.Then he went to the basement and started searching for the dairy but he can't find the dairy because the lab was very vast. He was tired and to up stairs after completing the dinner he went to bed.
        Next morning his grandma told him that your grandfather wants to properly use that element ,but unfortunately he didn't. So, you need to full fill his dream boy.Then again he started searching for the dairy.He found chart in that there is a diagram exactly looks like a device.But he found that one part of the device is missing part that may be the main part of the device.he taught i can find out this after i got the dairy then again started searching.Then his cousin jagruthi came to his grandmather's home.Ishak started explaining about what is happening there.Then they both satrted searching.

        Finally Ishak found the dairy in that his grand father wrote about the device and where is the missing.Then they both went to that place abd bought that part to the lab.In next he wrote about the how device runs.Thier work is not only to fix that part but also it needs a chemical to run that device.There is almost complete procedure to prepare the chemical.By god's grace jagruthi is a <em>"Chemist"</em>.They both went to up satirs and asked grand about about the chemicals she said that she cleaned the lab at that time she gave all those to a unknown chemist.Then then they both decided to prepare and started purchasing the chemicals through online and some through from her lab.
